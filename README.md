# Reggie

Reggie is a Registry stress generator for Windows. It's used to generate read/write registry operations and measure how well the system is performing.

Select the test parameters (I/O Type, I/O Size, and Worker Threads) and click Start. Reggie displays IOPS (operations per second), Throughput (Kilobytes per second), and Latency (average completion time).
